						<p><span class="h6">Background</span><a href="https://mpact2wo.com/" target="_blank">mPACT2WO</a> by Molex is an IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) platform offering sensor-based early detection solutions for emissions and corrosion monitoring in oil & gas, petrochemical and manufacturing industries. The solutions help operators of refineries, pipelines and plants identify problems early and fix them fast.</p>

						<p><span class="h6">My Role &amp; Contributions</span>I was the lead designer and owner of UX strategy and execution for mPACT2WO platform and all its web and mobile applications - from early pilots through market adoption. Joining the group in early 2019 as the 'UX team of one', I laid the UX groundwork, established a design system and carried out end-to-end UX/UI design from concepts to launch. Since 2022 I led a small team of exceptionally talented designers and technologists, while remaining a strong individual contributor. </p>
						<p>I focused my work on delivering simple user experiences while supporting complex customer needs. For example, the mobile app I designed makes it easy for refinery operators to document gas leak search and repair in often hard field conditions, while following complex EPA compliance requirements. I delivered operational dashboards that equip site managers with actionable insights and save them time, systems to track compliance tasks with clarity and ease, app navigation to simplify user path to action. Leveraging my development skills and interest in data visualization, I created the core emissions data visualization interface that effectively translates complex scientific algorithms into actionable visual information for operators to quickly locate and fix gas leaks. It is now the product's flagship feature that earned a published <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US11928304B2/en" target="_blank">patent</a>.</p>

						<p>Exploratory data visualization is one of my favorite areas of design. I have a deep interest in how complex data can be made accessible and meaningful through visual representation. In the mPACT2WO platform, I designed and developed interactive data visualization interfaces that help field operators quickly identify and resolve gas leaks in real-time, and allow site managers to evaluate operational status, explore historical data patterns and make informed decisions.</p>

						<p><span class="h6">Background</span> REMEDI was Purdue University's evidence-based community of practice for medical device informatics aimed at patient safety and medication quality. Latest REMEDI applications were developed and launched in 2015-2018.

tripled in size in 3 years to serve over 400 hospitals across 32 US states and internationally.</p>
<p>Developed front-end of REMEDI applications and a supporting data visualization library based on D3.js.</p>
<p>Tackled ambiguity associated with an innovative product and the complexity of multi-variant, irregular
customer data to design and deliver highly intuitive data analytics applications that made it easy for
clinicians to uncover problem areas in their practice, compare device settings with other hospitals and
benchmark against community best practices.</p>

						<p><span class="h6">Background</span>HUBzero is an open source software platform for building powerful Web sites that support scientific discovery, learning, and collaboration. Such web sites, or "hubs", become a focal point for its user community. The HUBzero platform now supports dozens of hubs across a variety of disciplines, including cancer research, pharmaceuticals, biofuels, microelectromechanical systems, climate modeling, water quality, volcanology, and more.</p>

						<p><span class="h6">My Work</span>My work on the HUBzero platform included designing and developing the core data sharing and publishing solution - <i>Projects</i> - that allows teams to share and publish their research data, software, publications and other digital products. I also contributed to the design and development of various other functional components of the platform, including the jobs board, wishlist, a system for simulation tool contributions from user community, a virtual point system to encourage user engagement and more. Some of this work started on nanoHUB.org (prior to 2010) - the oldest nanotechnology-focused hub and parent of the HUBzero platform.</p>
						<p>For each functional component my work involved conducting user research, collecting requirements, interactive prototyping, data model design, visual and interaction design, as well as complete front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and back-end (PHP+MySQL) coding within HUBzero framework.</p>

In the first session the team drew assumption personas and user journeys from what we knew about current users. With user interviews conducted between sessions and insights shared, the second sprint focused on ideation around content discovery feature in the new application. This was a young project. Each sprint sparked ideas to prototype and test, as well as helped identify areas where additional user research was needed.</p>
